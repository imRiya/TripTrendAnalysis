# Trip Trend Analysis
Uber Demand Forecasting

Project Overview
In order to forecast and analyze the demand for vehicle dispatching, this project uses data such as dispatching bases, dates, active cars, and trip counts. Machine learning models are used in the project to forecast trip demand and spot trends after exploratory data analysis (EDA) is completed to obtain insights into the data. Understanding patterns in vehicle utilization and assisting in the optimization of dispatching operations are the ultimate goals.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
dispatching_base: Unique identifier for each dispatch base.
date: Date of dispatch activity.
active_vehicles: Number of active vehicles available each day.
trips: Number of trips completed by dispatching bases per day.


Steps involved:
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.Machine Learning Models
3.Evaluation and Visualization

Packages:
pandas, numpy for data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn, sklearn for machine learning models
